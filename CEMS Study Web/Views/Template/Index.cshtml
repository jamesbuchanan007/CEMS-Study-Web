    § 75.19 &emsp;Optional SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Calculation for Low Mass Emissions (LME) Units
</h3>
<ol type="a">
    <li>
        <em>Applicability and Qualification</em>.
        <ol>
            <li>
                For units that meet the requirements
                of this paragraph (a)(1) and paragraphs
                (a)(2) and (b) of this section, the low
                mass emissions (LME) excepted methodology
                in paragraph (c) of this section
                may be used in lieu of continuous emission
                monitoring systems or, if applicable,
                in lieu of methods under appendices
                D, E, and G to this part, for the
                purpose of determining unit heat input,
                NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> mass emissions, and
                NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate under this part. If
                the owner or operator of a qualifying
                unit elects to use the LME methodology,
                it must be used for all parameters
                that are required to be monitored
                by the applicable program(s). For example,
                for an Acid Rain Program LME
                unit, the methodology must be used to
                estimate SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub> mass emissions,
                NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate, and unit heat
                input.

                                based upon a combination of actual
                                historical SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> mass emissions
                                data and projected SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub>
                                mass emissions, totaling three years
                                (or ozone seasons). Except as provided
                                in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, actual
                                data must be used for any years
                                (or ozone seasons) in which such data
                                exists and projected data should be
                                used for any remaining future years (or
                                ozone seasons) needed to provide emissions
                                data for three consecutive calendar
                                years (or ozone seasons). For example,
                                if a unit commenced operation
                                two years ago, the designated representative
                                may submit actual, historical
                                data for the previous two years
                                and one year of projected emissions for
                                the current calendar year or, for a new
                                unit, the designated representative
                                may submit three years of projected
                                emissions, beginning with the current
                                calendar year. Any actual or projected
                                annual emissions must demonstrate to
                                the satisfaction of the Administrator
                                that the unit will emit less than the
                                applicable number of tons of SO<sub>2</sub> and/or
                                NO<sub>x</sub> specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A)

                When the owner or operator elects
                to demonstrate initial LME qualification
                and on-going compliance using a
                fuel-and-unit-specific NO<sub>x</sub> emission
                (c)(1)(iv) of this section, there will be
                instances (e.g., for a new or newly-affected
                unit) where it is not possible to
                determine that NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate prior
                to submitting the certification application.
                In such cases, if the generic default
                NO<sub>x</sub> emission rates in Table LM–
                2 of this section are inappropriately
                high for the unit, the owner or operator
                may use a more representative,
                but conservatively high estimate of the
                expected NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate, for the
                purposes of the initial monitoring plan
                submittal and to calculate the unit’s
                projected annual or ozone season emissions
                under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of
                this section. For example, the NO<sub>x</sub>
                emission rate could, as described in
                paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section,
                be estimated using historical CEM data
                or historical emission test data that is
                representative of operation at normal
                load. The NO<sub>x</sub> emission limit specified
                in the operating permit for the unit
                could also be used to estimate the NO<sub>x</sub>
                emission rate (except for units
                equipped with SCR or SNCR), or, consistent
                with paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(4) of
                this section, for a unit that uses SCR
                or SNCR to control NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, an
                estimated default NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate of
                0.15 lb/mmBtu could be used. However,
                these estimated NO<sub>x</sub> emission rates
                may not be used for reporting purposes
                in the time period extending from the
                first hour in which the LME methodology
                is used to the date and hour on
                which the fuel-and-unit-specific NO<sub>x</sub>
                emission rate testing is completed.
                Rather, in that interval, the owner or
                operator shall either report the appropriate
                default NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate from
                Table LM–2, or shall report the maximum
                potential NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate, calculated
                in accordance with § 72.2 of this
                chapter and section 2.1.2.1 of appendix
                A to this part. Then, beginning with
                the first unit operating hour after completion
                of the tests, the appropriate default
                NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate(s) obtained
                from the fuel-and-unit-specific testing
                shall be used for emissions reporting.

                        in a format suitable for inspection and

                                groups, according to the type of fuel

                                when multiple fuels were combusted.
                                Each fuel-specific data set must contain
                                at least 168 hours of data and must
                                represent all normal operating ranges
                                of the unit when combusting the fuel.
                                Sort the data in each fuel-specific data
                                set in ascending order according to
                                NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate. Determine the 95th

                                data set as defined in § 72.2 of this chapter.
                                Use the 95th percentile value for
                                each data set as the fuel-and-unit-specific
                                NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate, except that for
                                a unit that uses SCR or SNCR for NO<sub>x</sub>
                                emission control, if the 95th percentile
                                value is less than 0.15 lb/mmBtu, a
                                value of 0.15 lb/mmBtu shall be used as

                                        Determine the range of operation
                                        of the unit, according to section 6.5.2.1
                                        of appendix A to this part. Divide the
                                        range of operation into four equal load
                                        bands. For example, if the range of operation
                                        extends from 20 MW to 100 MW,
                                        the four equal load bands would be:
                                        band #1: from 20 MW to 40 MW; band #2:
                                        from 41 MW to 60 MW; band #3: from 61
                                        MW to 80 MW; and band #4: from 81 to
                                        100 MW. Then, perform a historical
                                        load analysis for all unit operating
                                        hours in the 12 calendar quarters preceding
                                        the quarter of the test. Alternatively,
                                        for sources that report emissions
                                        data only during the ozone season,
                                        the historical load analysis may
                                        be based on unit operation in the previous
                                        three ozone seasons, rather than
                                        unit operation in the previous 12 calendar
                                        quarters. Determine the percentage
                                        of the data that fall into each load
                                        band. For a unit that is not part of a
                                        group of identical units, if 85.0% or
                                        more of the data fall into one load
                                        band, single-load testing may be performed
                                        at any point within that load
                                        band. For a group of identical units, if
                                        each unit in the group meets the 85.0%
                                        criterion, then representative singleload
                                        testing within the load band may
                                        be performed. If the 85.0% criterion
                                        cannot be met to qualify for singleload
                                        testing but this criterion can be
                                        met cumulatively for two (or three)
                                        load levels, then testing may be performed
                                        at two (or three) loads instead
                                        of four.

                                        point temperature analysis may be
                                        based on unit operation in the previous

                                mass emission calculation methodology
                                of paragraph (c)(3) of this section,

                                (mmBtu) to a low mass emissions unit
                                shall be deemed to equal the maximum
                                rated hourly heat input, as defined in
                                § 72.2 of this chapter, multiplied by the
                                operating time of the unit for each
                                hour. The owner or operator may
                                choose to record and report partial operating
                                hours or may assume that a
                                unit operated for a whole hour for each
                                hour the unit operated. However, the
                                owner or operator of a unit may petition
                                the Administrator under § 75.66 for
                                a lower value for maximum rated hourly
                                heat input than that defined in § 72.2
                                of this chapter. The Administrator
                                may approve such lower value if the
                                owner or operator demonstrates that
                                either the maximum hourly heat input
                                specified by the manufacturer or the
                                highest observed hourly heat input, or
                                both, are not representative, and such
                                a lower value is representative, of the
                                unit’s current capabilities because
                                modifications have been made to the
                                unit, limiting its capacity permanently.
