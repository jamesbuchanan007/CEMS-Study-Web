<h4>2.1&emsp;<em>Instrument Span and Range</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>
    In implementing sections 2.1.1 through 2.1.6 of this appendix, set the measurement range for each parameter (SO2, NOX, CO2, O2, or flow rate) high enough to prevent full-scale exceedances from occurring, yet low enough to ensure good measurement accuracy and to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio. To meet these objectives, select the range such that the majority of the readings obtained during typical unit operation are kept, to the extent practicable, between 20.0 and 80.0 percent of the full-scale range of the instrument. These guidelines do not apply to: (1) SO2 readings obtained during the combustion of very low sulfur fuel (as defined in §72.2 of this chapter); (2) SO2 or NOX readings recorded on the high measurement range, for units with SO2 or NOX emission controls and two span values, unless the emission controls are operated seasonally (for example, only during the ozone season); or (3) SO2 or NOX readings less than 20.0 percent of full-scale on the low measurement range for a dual span unit, provided that the maximum expected concentration (MEC), low-scale span value, and low-scale range settings have been determined according to sections 2.1.1.2, 2.1.1.4(a), (b), and (g) of this appendix (for SO2), or according to sections 2.1.2.2, 2.1.2.4(a) and (f) of this appendix (for NOX).

        2.1.1&emsp;<em>SO2 Pollutant Concentration Monitors</em>
    </h5>

        <li>
            Determine, as indicated in sections 2.1.1.1 through 2.1.1.5 of this appendix the span value(s) and range(s) for an SO2 pollutant concentration monitor so that all potential and expected concentrations can be accurately measured and recorded. Note that if a unit exclusively combusts fuels that are very low sulfur fuels (as defined in §72.2 of this chapter), the SO2 monitor span requirements in §75.11(e)(3)(iv) apply in lieu of the requirements of this section.

                            Make an initial determination of the maximum potential concentration (MPC) of SO2 by using Equation A-1a or A-1b. Base the MPC calculation on the maximum percent sulfur and the minimum gross calorific value (GCV) for the highest-sulfur fuel to be burned. The maximum sulfur content and minimum GCV shall be determined from all available fuel sampling and analysis data for that fuel from the previous 12 months (minimum), excluding clearly anomalous fuel sampling values. If both the fuel sulfur content and the GCV are routinely determined from each fuel sample, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to using the highest individual percent sulfur and lowest individual GCV values in the MPC calculation, pair the sulfur content and GCV values from each sample analysis and calculate the ratio of percent sulfur to GCV (i.e., %S/GCV) for each pair of values. If this option is selected, the MPC shall be calculated using the highest %S/GCV ratio in Equation A-1a or A-1b. If the designated representative certifies that the highest-sulfur fuel is never burned alone in the unit during normal operation but is always blended or co-fired with other fuel(s), the MPC may be calculated using a best estimate of the highest sulfur content and lowest gross calorific value expected for the blend or fuel mixture and inserting these values into Equation A-1a or A-1b. Derive the best estimate of the highest percent sulfur and lowest GCV for a blend or fuel mixture from weighted-average values based upon the historical composition of the blend or mixture in the previous 12 (or more) months. If insufficient representative fuel sampling data are available to determine the maximum sulfur content and minimum GCV, use values from contract(s) for the fuel(s) that will be combusted by the unit in the MPC calculation.

                            Alternatively, if a certified SO2 CEMS is already installed, the owner or operator may make the initial MPC determination based upon quality-assured historical data recorded by the CEMS. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.1.1, a “certified” CEMS means a CEM system that has met the applicable certification requirements of either: This part, or part 60 of this chapter, or a State CEM program, or the source operating permit. If this option is chosen, the MPC shall be the maximum SO2 concentration observed during the previous 720 (or more) quality-assured monitor operating hours when combusting the highest-sulfur fuel (or highest-sulfur blend if fuels are always blended or co-fired) that is to be combusted in the unit or units monitored by the SO2 monitor. For units with SO2 emission controls, the certified SO2 monitor used to determine the MPC must be located at or before the control device inlet. Report the MPC and the method of determination in the monitoring plan required under §75.53. Note that the initial MPC value is subject to periodic review under section 2.1.1.5 of this appendix. If an MPC value is found to be either inappropriately high or low, the MPC shall be adjusted in accordance with section 2.1.1.5, and corresponding span and range adjustments shall be made, if necessary.

                                    When two SO2 spans are required, the owner or operator may either use a single SO2 analyzer with a dual range (i.e., low- and high-scales) or two separate SO2 analyzers connected to a common sample probe and sample interface. Alternatively, if RATAs are performed and passed on both measurement ranges, the owner or operator may use two separate SO2 analyzers connected to separate probes and sample interfaces. For units with SO2 emission controls, the owner or operator may use a low range analyzer and a default high range value, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, in lieu of maintaining and quality assuring a high-scale range. Other monitor configurations are subject to the approval of the Administrator.

                                    The owner or operator shall designate the monitoring systems and components in the monitoring plan under §75.53 as follows: when a single probe and sample interface are used, either designate the low and high monitor ranges as separate SO2 components of a single, primary SO2 monitoring system; designate the low and high monitor ranges as the SO2 components of two separate, primary SO2 monitoring systems; designate the normal monitor range as a primary monitoring system and the other monitor range as a non-redundant backup monitoring system; or, when a single, dual-range SO2 analyzer is used, designate the low and high ranges as a single SO2 component of a primary SO2 monitoring system (if this option is selected, use a special dual-range component type code, as specified by the Administrator, to satisfy the requirements of §75.53(e)(1)(iv)(D)). When two SO2 analyzers are connected to separate probes and sample interfaces, designate the analyzers as the SO2 components of two separate, primary SO2 monitoring systems. For units with SO2 controls, if the default high range value is used, designate the low range analyzer as the SO2 component of a primary SO2 monitoring system. Do not designate the default high range as a monitoring system or component. Other component and system designations are subject to approval by the Administrator. Note that the component and system designations for redundant backup monitoring systems shall be the same as for primary monitoring systems.

                                    Each monitoring system designated as primary or redundant backup shall meet the initial certification and quality assurance requirements for primary monitoring systems in §75.20(c) or §75.20(d)(1), as applicable, and appendices A and B to this part, with one exception: relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) are required only on the normal range (for units with SO2 emission controls, the low range is considered normal). Each monitoring system designated as a non-redundant backup shall meet the applicable quality assurance requirements in §75.20(d)(2).

                                    For dual span units with SO2 emission controls, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to maintaining and quality assuring a high monitor range, use a default high range value. If this option is chosen, the owner or operator shall report a default SO2 concentration of 200 percent of the MPC for each unit operating hour in which the full-scale of the low range SO2 analyzer is exceeded.

                                    The high span value and range shall be determined in accordance with section 2.1.1.3 of this appendix. The low span value shall be obtained by multiplying the MEC by a factor no less than 1.00 and no greater than 1.25, and rounding the result upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm (or 100 ppm, as appropriate). For units that burn high- and low-sulfur primary and backup fuels or blends and have no SO2 emission controls, select, as the basis for calculating the appropriate low span value and range, the fuel-specific MEC value closest to 20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value (from paragraph (b) of this section). The low range must be greater than or equal to the low span value, and the required calibration gases must be selected based on the low span value. However, if the default high range option in paragraph (f) of this section is selected, the full-scale of the low measurement range shall not exceed five times the MEC value (where the MEC is rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm). For units with two SO2 spans, use the low range whenever the SO2 concentrations are expected to be consistently below 20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value, i.e., when the MEC of the fuel or blend being combusted is less than 20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value. When the full-scale of the low range is exceeded, the high range shall be used to measure and record the SO2 concentrations; or, if applicable, the default high range value in paragraph (f) of this section shall be reported for each hour of the full-scale exceedance.

Span and range adjustments may be required, for example, as a result of changes in the fuel supply, changes in the manner of operation of the unit, or installation or removal of emission controls. In implementing the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, SO2 data recorded during short-term, non-representative process operating conditions (e.g., a trial burn of a different type of fuel) shall be excluded from consideration. The owner or operator shall keep the results of the most recent span and range evaluation on-site, in a format suitable for inspection. Make each required span or range adjustment no later than 45 days after the end of the quarter in which the need to adjust the span or range is identified, except that up to 90 days after the end of that quarter may be taken to implement a span adjustment if the calibration gases currently being used for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are unsuitable for use with the new span value.

A “significant” change in the MPC or MEC means that the guidelines in section 2.1 of this appendix can no longer be met, as determined by either a periodic evaluation by the owner or operator or from the results of an audit by the Administrator. The owner or operator should evaluate whether any planned changes in operation of the unit may affect the concentration of emissions being emitted from the unit or stack and should plan any necessary span and range changes needed to account for these changes, so that they are made in as timely a manner as practicable to coordinate with the operational changes. Determine the adjusted span(s) using the procedures in sections 2.1.1.3 and 2.1.1.4 of this appendix (as applicable). Select the full-scale range(s) of the instrument to be greater than or equal to the new span value(s) and to be consistent with the guidelines of section 2.1 of this appendix.

However, if either of these quality assurance tests has expired and the high range is not able to provide quality assured data at the time of the low range exceedance or at any time during the continuation of the exceedance, report the MPC as the SO2 concentration until the readings return to the low range or until the high range is able to provide quality assured data (unless the reason that the high-scale range is not able to provide quality assured data is because the high-scale range has been exceeded; if the high-scale range is exceeded follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).

The monitoring plan update shall be made in the quarter in which the changes become effective. In addition, record and report the adjusted span as part of the records for the daily calibration error test and linearity check specified by appendix B to this part. Whenever the span value is adjusted, use calibration gas concentrations that meet the requirements of section 5.1 of this appendix, based on the adjusted span value.

                <li>
                    The maximum potential concentration (MPC) of NOX for each affected unit shall be based upon whichever fuel or blend combusted in the unit produces the highest level of NOX emissions. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.2.1, and section 2.1.2.2 of this appendix, a “blend” means a frequently-used fuel mixture having a consistent composition (e.g., an oil and gas mixture where the relative proportions of the two fuels vary by no more than 10%, on average). Make an initial determination of the MPC using the appropriate option as follows:

                        <li>
                            Option 1: Use 800 ppm for coal-fired and 400 ppm for oil- or gas-fired units as the maximum potential concentration of NOX (if an MPC of 1600 ppm for coal-fired units or 480 ppm for oil- or gas-fired units was previously selected under this section, that value may still be used, provided that the guidelines of section 2.1 of this appendix are met); For cement kilns, use 2000 ppm as the MPC. For process heaters, use 200 ppm if the unit burns only gaseous fuel and 500 ppm if the unit burns oil;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Option 2: Use the specific values based on boiler type and fuel combusted, listed in Table 2-1 or Table 2-2; For a new gas-fired or oil-fired combustion turbine, if a default MPC value of 50 ppm was previously selected from Table 2-2, that value may be used until March 31, 2003;

                        <li>
                            Option 4: Use historical CEM data over the previous 720 (or more) unit operating hours when combusting the fuel or blend with the highest NOX emission rate; or
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Option 5: If a reliable estimate of the uncontrolled NOX emissions from the unit is available from the manufacturer, the estimated value may be used.

                    For the purpose of providing substitute data during NOX missing data periods in accordance with §§75.31 and 75.33 and as required elsewhere under this part, the owner or operator shall also calculate the maximum potential NOX emission rate (MER), in lb/mmBtu, by substituting the MPC for NOX in conjunction with the minimum expected CO2 or maximum O2 concentration (under all unit operating conditions except for unit startup, shutdown, and upsets) and the appropriate F-factor into the applicable equation in appendix F to this part. The diluent cap value of 5.0 percent CO2 (or 14.0 percent O2) for boilers or 1.0 percent CO2 (or 19.0 percent O2) for combustion turbines may be used in the NOX MER calculation. As a second alternative, when the NOX MPC is determined from emission test results or from historical CEM data, as described in paragraphs (a), (d) and (e) of this section, quality-assured diluent gas (i.e., O2 or CO2) data recorded concurrently with the MPC may be used to calculate the MER.

                    Report the method of determining the initial MPC and the calculation of the maximum potential NOX emission rate in the monitoring plan for the unit. Note that whichever MPC option in paragraph 2.1.2.1(a) of this appendix is selected, the initial MPC value is subject to periodic review under section 2.1.2.5 of this appendix. If an MPC value is found to be either inappropriately high or low, the MPC shall be adjusted in accordance with section 2.1.2.5, and corresponding span and range adjustments shall be made, if necessary.

                    For units with add-on NOX controls (whether or not the unit is equipped with low-NOX burner technology), or for units equipped with dry low-NOX (DLN) technology, NOX emission testing may only be used to determine the MPC if testing can be performed either upstream of the add-on controls or during a time or season when the add-on controls are not in operation or when the DLN controls are not in the premixed (low-NOX) mode. If NOX emission testing is performed, use the following guidelines. Use Method 7E from appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to measure total NOX concentration. (Note: Method 20 from appendix A to part 60 may be used for gas turbines, instead of Method 7E.) Operate the unit, or group of units sharing a common stack, at the minimum safe and stable load, the normal load, and the maximum load. If the normal load and maximum load are identical, an intermediate level need not be tested. Operate at the highest excess O2 level expected under normal operating conditions. Make at least three runs of 20 minutes (minimum) duration with three traverse points per run at each operating condition. Select the highest point NOX concentration from all test runs as the MPC for NOX.

                <li>
                    If historical CEM data are used to determine the MPC, the data must, for uncontrolled units or units equipped with low-NOX burner technology and no other NOX controls, represent a minimum of 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours from the NOX component of a certified monitoring system, obtained under various operating conditions including the minimum safe and stable load, normal load (including periods of high excess air at normal load), and maximum load. For the purposes of this section, 2.1.2.1, a “certified” CEMS means a CEM system that has met the applicable certification requirements of either: this part, or part 60 of this chapter, or a State CEM program, or the source operating permit. For a unit with add-on NOX controls (whether or not the unit is equipped with low-NOX burner technology), or for a unit equipped with dry low-NOX (DLN) technology, historical CEM data may only be used to determine the MPC if the 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours of CEM data are collected upstream of the add-on controls or if the 720 hours of data include periods when the add-on controls are not in operation or when the DLN controls are not in the premixed (low-NOX mode). For units that do not produce electrical or thermal output, the data must represent the full range of normal process operation. The highest hourly NOX concentration in ppm shall be the MPC.

Determine a separate MEC value for each type of fuel (or blend) combusted in the unit, except for fuels that are only used for unit startup and/or flame stabilization. Calculate the MEC of NOX using Equation A-2, if applicable, inserting the maximum potential concentration, as determined using the procedures in section 2.1.2.1 of this appendix. Where Equation A-2 is not applicable, set the MEC either by: (1) measuring the NOX concentration using the testing procedures in this section; (2) using historical CEM data over the previous 720 (or more) quality-assured monitor operating hours; or (3) if the unit has add-on NOX controls or uses dry low NOX technology, and has a federally-enforceable permit limit for NOX concentration, the permit limit may be used as the MEC.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For most units, the high span value based on the MPC, as determined under section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix will suffice to measure and record NOX concentrations (unless span and/or range adjustments must be made in accordance with section 2.1.2.5 of this appendix). In some instances, however, a second (low) span value based on the MEC may be required to ensure accurate measurement of all expected and potential NOX concentrations. To determine whether two NOX spans are required, proceed as follows:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            (a) Compare the MEC value(s) determined in section 2.1.2.2 of this appendix to the high full-scale range value determined in section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix. If the MEC values for all fuels (or blends) are ≥20.0 percent of the high range value, the high span and range values determined under section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix are sufficient, irrespective of which fuel or blend is combusted in the unit. If any of the MEC values is &lt; 20.0 percent of the high range value, two spans (low and high) are required, one based on the MPC and the other based on the MEC.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (b) When two NOX spans are required, the owner or operator may either use a single NOX analyzer with a dual range (low-and high-scales) or two separate NOX analyzers connected to a common sample probe and sample interface. Two separate NOX analyzers connected to separate probes and sample interfaces may be used if RATAs are passed on both ranges. For units with add-on NOX emission controls (e.g., steam injection, water injection, SCR, or SNCR) or units equipped with dry low-NOX technology, the owner or operator may use a low range analyzer and a “default high range value,” as described in paragraph 2.1.2.4(e) of this section, in lieu of maintaining and quality assuring a high-scale range. Other monitor configurations are subject to the approval of the Administrator.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (c) The owner or operator shall designate the monitoring systems and components in the monitoring plan under §75.53 as follows: when a single probe and sample interface are used, either designate the low and high ranges as separate NOX components of a single, primary NOX monitoring system; designate the low and high ranges as the NOX components of two separate, primary NOX monitoring systems; designate the normal range as a primary monitoring system and the other range as a non-redundant backup monitoring system; or, when a single, dual-range NOX analyzer is used, designate the low and high ranges as a single NOX component of a primary NOX monitoring system (if this option is selected, use a special dual-range component type code, as specified by the Administrator, to satisfy the requirements of §75.53(e)(1)(iv)(D)). When two NOX analyzers are connected to separate probes and sample interfaces, designate the analyzers as the NOX components of two separate, primary NOX monitoring systems. For units with add-on NOX controls or units equipped with dry low-NOX technology, if the default high range value is used, designate the low range analyzer as the NOX component of the primary NOX monitoring system. Do not designate the default high range as a monitoring system or component. Other component and system designations are subject to approval by the Administrator. Note that the component and system designations for redundant backup monitoring systems shall be the same as for primary monitoring systems.

                        <li>
                            (d) Each monitoring system designated as primary or redundant backup shall meet the initial certification and quality assurance requirements in §75.20(c) (for primary monitoring systems), in §75.20(d)(1) (for redundant backup monitoring systems) and appendices A and B to this part, with one exception: relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) are required only on the normal range (for dual span units with add-on NOX emission controls, the low range is considered normal). Each monitoring system designated as non-redundant backup shall meet the applicable quality assurance requirements in §75.20(d)(2).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (e) For dual span units with add-on NOX emission controls (e.g., steam injection, water injection, SCR, or SNCR), or, for units that use dry low NOX technology, the owner or operator may, as an alternative to maintaining and quality assuring a high monitor range, use a default high range value. If this option is chosen, the owner or operator shall report a default value of 200.0 percent of the MPC for each unit operating hour in which the full-scale of the low range NOX analyzer is exceeded.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (f) The high span and range shall be determined in accordance with section 2.1.2.3 of this appendix. The low span value shall be 100.0 to 125.0 percent of the MEC, rounded up to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm (or 100 ppm, if appropriate). If more than one MEC value (as determined in section 2.1.2.2 of this appendix) is &lt; 20.0 percent of the high full-scale range value, the low span value shall be based upon whichever MEC value is closest to 20.0 percent of the high range value. The low range must be greater than or equal to the low span value, and the required calibration gases for the low range must be selected based on the low span value. However, if the default high range option in paragraph (e) of this section is selected, the full-scale of the low measurement range shall not exceed five times the MEC value (where the MEC is rounded upward to the next highest multiple of 10 ppm). For units with two NOX spans, use the low range whenever NOX concentrations are expected to be consistently &lt; 20.0 percent of the high range value, i.e., when the MEC of the fuel being combusted is &lt; 20.0 percent of the high range value. When the full-scale of the low range is exceeded, the high range shall be used to measure and record the NOX concentrations; or, if applicable, the default high range value in paragraph (e) of this section shall be reported for each hour of the full-scale exceedance.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    For each affected unit or common stack, the owner or operator shall make a periodic evaluation of the MPC, MEC, span, and range values for each NOX monitor (at a minimum, an annual evaluation is required) and shall make any necessary span and range adjustments, with corresponding monitoring plan updates, as described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. Span and range adjustments may be required, for example, as a result of changes in the fuel supply, changes in the manner of operation of the unit, or installation or removal of emission controls. In implementing the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, note that NOX data recorded during short-term, non-representative operating conditions (e.g., a trial burn of a different type of fuel) shall be excluded from consideration. The owner or operator shall keep the results of the most recent span and range evaluation on-site, in a format suitable for inspection. Make each required span or range adjustment no later than 45 days after the end of the quarter in which the need to adjust the span or range is identified, except that up to 90 days after the end of that quarter may be taken to implement a span adjustment if the calibration gases currently being used for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are unsuitable for use with the new span value.

                            (a) If the fuel supply, emission controls, or other process parameters change such that the maximum expected concentration or the maximum potential concentration changes significantly, adjust the NOX pollutant concentration span(s) and (if necessary) monitor range(s) to assure the continued accuracy of the monitoring system. A “significant” change in the MPC or MEC means that the guidelines in section 2.1 of this appendix can no longer be met, as determined by either a periodic evaluation by the owner or operator or from the results of an audit by the Administrator. The owner or operator should evaluate whether any planned changes in operation of the unit or stack may affect the concentration of emissions being emitted from the unit and should plan any necessary span and range changes needed to account for these changes, so that they are made in as timely a manner as practicable to coordinate with the operational changes. An example of a change that may require a span and range adjustment is the installation of low-NOX burner technology on a previously uncontrolled unit. Determine the adjusted span(s) using the procedures in section 2.1.2.3 or 2.1.2.4 of this appendix (as applicable). Select the full-scale range(s) of the instrument to be greater than or equal to the adjusted span value(s) and to be consistent with the guidelines of section 2.1 of this appendix.

                            (b) Whenever a full-scale range is exceeded during a quarter and the exceedance is not caused by a monitor out-of-control period, proceed as follows:
                            <ol>

                                    (1) For exceedances of the high range, report 200.0 percent of the current full-scale range as the hourly NOX concentration for each hour of the full-scale exceedance and make appropriate adjustments to the MPC, span, and range to prevent future full-scale exceedances.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    (2) For units with two NOX spans and ranges, if the low range is exceeded, no further action is required, provided that the high range is available and its most recent calibration error test and linearity check have not expired. However, if either of these quality assurance tests has expired and the high range is not able to provide quality assured data at the time of the low range exceedance or at any time during the continuation of the exceedance, report the MPC as the NOX concentration until the readings return to the low range or until the high range is able to provide quality assured data (unless the reason that the high-scale range is not able to provide quality assured data is because the high-scale range has been exceeded; if the high-scale range is exceeded, follow the procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section).
                                </li>

                            (c) Whenever changes are made to the MPC, MEC, full-scale range, or span value of the NOX monitor as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, record and report (as applicable) the new full-scale range setting, the new MPC or MEC, maximum potential NOX emission rate, and the adjusted span value in an updated monitoring plan for the unit. The monitoring plan update shall be made in the quarter in which the changes become effective. In addition, record and report the adjusted span as part of the records for the daily calibration error test and linearity check required by appendix B to this part. Whenever the span value is adjusted, use calibration gas concentrations that meet the requirements of section 5.1 of this appendix, based on the adjusted span value. When a span adjustment is significant enough that the calibration gases currently being used for daily calibration error tests and linearity checks are unsuitable for use with the new span value, a diagnostic linearity test using the new calibration gases must be performed and passed. Use the data validation procedures in §75.20(b)(3), beginning with the hour in which the span is changed.

            For an O2 monitor (including O2 monitors used to measure CO2 emissions or percentage moisture), select a span value between 15.0 and 25.0 percent O2. For a CO2 monitor installed on a boiler, select a span value between 14.0 and 20.0 percent CO2. For a CO2 monitor installed on a combustion turbine, an alternative span value between 6.0 and 14.0 percent CO2 may be used. An alternative CO2 span value below 6.0 percent may be used if an appropriate technical justification is included in the hardcopy monitoring plan. An alternative O2 span value below 15.0 percent O2 may be used if an appropriate technical justification is included in the monitoring plan (e.g., O2 concentrations above a certain level create an unsafe operating condition). Select the full-scale range of the instrument to be consistent with section 2.1 of this appendix and to be greater than or equal to the span value. Select the calibration gas concentrations for the daily calibration error tests and linearity checks in accordance with section 5.1 of this appendix, as percentages of the span value. For O2 monitors with span values ≥21.0 percent O2, purified instrument air containing 20.9 percent O2 may be used as the high-level calibration material. If a dual-range or autoranging diluent analyzer is installed, the analyzer may be represented in the monitoring plan as a single component, using a special component type code specified by the Administrator to satisfy the requirements of §75.53(e)(1)(iv)(D).

If using test values, use the highest average velocity (determined from the Method 2 traverses) measured at or near the maximum unit operating load (or, for units that do not produce electrical or thermal output, at the normal process operating conditions corresponding to the maximum stack gas flow rate). Express the MPV in units of wet standard feet per minute (fpm). For the purpose of providing substitute data during periods of missing flow rate data in accordance with §§75.31 and 75.33 and as required elsewhere in this part, calculate the maximum potential stack gas flow rate (MPF) in units of standard cubic feet per hour (scfh), as the product of the MPV (in units of wet, standard fpm) times 60, times the cross-sectional area of the stack or duct (in ft2) at the flow monitor location.

Convert the MPV, as determined in section 2.1.4.1 of this appendix, to the same measurement units of flow rate that are used for daily calibration error tests (e.g., scfh, kscfh, kacfm, or differential pressure (inches of water)). Next, determine the “calibration span value” by multiplying the MPV (converted to equivalent daily calibration error units) by a factor no less than 1.00 and no greater than 1.25, and rounding up the result to at least two significant figures. For calibration span values in inches of water, retain at least two decimal places. Select appropriate reference signals for the daily calibration error tests as percentages of the calibration span value, as specified in section 2.2.2.1 of this appendix. Finally, calculate the “flow rate span value” (in scfh) as the product of the MPF, as determined in section 2.1.4.1 of this appendix, times the same factor (between 1.00 and 1.25) that was used to calculate the calibration span value. Round off the flow rate span value to the nearest 1000 scfh. Select the full-scale range of the flow monitor so that it is greater than or equal to the span value and is consistent with section 2.1 of this appendix. Include in the monitoring plan for the unit: calculations of the MPV, MPF, calibration span value, flow rate span value, and full-scale range (expressed both in scfh and, if different, in the measurement units of calibration).

                    For each affected unit or common stack, the owner or operator shall make a periodic evaluation of the MPV, MPF, span, and range values for each flow rate monitor (at a minimum, an annual evaluation is required) and shall make any necessary span and range adjustments with corresponding monitoring plan updates, as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section 2.1.4.3. Span and range adjustments may be required, for example, as a result of changes in the fuel supply, changes in the stack or ductwork configuration, changes in the manner of operation of the unit, or installation or removal of emission controls. In implementing the provisions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 2.1.4.3, note that flow rate data recorded during short-term, non-representative operating conditions (e.g., a trial burn of a different type of fuel) shall be excluded from consideration. The owner or operator shall keep the results of the most recent span and range evaluation on-site, in a format suitable for inspection. Make each required span or range adjustment no later than 45 days after the end of the quarter in which the need to adjust the span or range is identified.

                            (a) If the fuel supply, stack or ductwork configuration, operating parameters, or other conditions change such that the maximum potential flow rate changes significantly, adjust the span and range to assure the continued accuracy of the flow monitor. A “significant” change in the MPV or MPF means that the guidelines of section 2.1 of this appendix can no longer be met, as determined by either a periodic evaluation by the owner or operator or from the results of an audit by the Administrator. The owner or operator should evaluate whether any planned changes in operation of the unit may affect the flow of the unit or stack and should plan any necessary span and range changes needed to account for these changes, so that they are made in as timely a manner as practicable to coordinate with the operational changes. Calculate the adjusted calibration span and flow rate span values using the procedures in section 2.1.4.2 of this appendix.

                            (b) Whenever the full-scale range is exceeded during a quarter, provided that the exceedance is not caused by a monitor out-of-control period, report 200.0 percent of the current full-scale range as the hourly flow rate for each hour of the full-scale exceedance. If the range is exceeded, make appropriate adjustments to the MPF, flow rate span, and range to prevent future full-scale exceedances. Calculate the new calibration span value by converting the new flow rate span value from units of scfh to units of daily calibration. A calibration error test must be performed and passed to validate data on the new range.

                            (c) Whenever changes are made to the MPV, MPF, full-scale range, or span value of the flow monitor, as described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, record and report (as applicable) the new full-scale range setting, calculations of the flow rate span value, calibration span value, MPV, and MPF in an updated monitoring plan for the unit. The monitoring plan update shall be made in the quarter in which the changes become effective. Record and report the adjusted calibration span and reference values as parts of the records for the calibration error test required by appendix B to this part. Whenever the calibration span value is adjusted, use reference values for the calibration error test that meet the requirements of section 2.2.2.1 of this appendix, based on the most recent adjusted calibration span value. Perform a calibration error test according to section 2.1.1 of appendix B to this part whenever making a change to the flow monitor span or range, unless the range change also triggers a recertification under §75.20(b).

            Except as provided in section 2.1.6 of this appendix, the owner or operator of a unit that uses a continuous moisture monitoring system to correct emission rates and heat inputs from a dry basis to a wet basis (or vice-versa) shall, for the purpose of providing substitute data under §75.37, use a default value of 3.0 percent H2O as the minimum potential moisture percentage. Alternatively, the minimum potential moisture percentage may be based upon 720 hours or more of quality-assured CEM data, representing the full operating load range of the unit(s). If this option is chosen, the minimum potential moisture percentage shall be the lowest quality-assured hourly average H2O concentration recorded in the 720 (or more) hours of data used for the determination.
