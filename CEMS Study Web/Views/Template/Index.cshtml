    <li>For affected units that do not produce electrical output in megawatts or thermal output in klb/hr of steam, this procedure may be used in accordance with the provisions of this part to provide substitute data for volumetric flow rate (scfh), NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate (in lb/mmBtu) from NO<sub>x</sub>-diluent continuous emission monitoring systems, and NO<sub>x</sub> concentration data (in ppm) from NO<sub>x</sub> concentration monitoring systems used to determine NO<sub>x</sub> mass emissions. </li>

        <p>
            3.2.1&emsp;
            For each monitored parameter (flow rate, NO<sub>x</sub> emission rate, or NO<sub>x</sub> concentration), establish at least two, but no more than ten operational bins, corresponding to various operating conditions and parameters (or combinations of these) that affect volumetric flow rate or NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Include a complete description of each operational bin in the hard copy portion of the monitoring plan required under §75.53(e)(2), identifying the unique combination of parameters and operating conditions associated with the bin and explaining the relationship between these parameters and conditions and the magnitude of the stack gas flow rate or NO<sub>x</sub> emissions. Assign a unique number, 1 through 10, to each operational bin. Examples of conditions and parameters that may be used to define operational bins include unit heat input, type of fuel combusted, specific stages of an industrial process, or (for common stacks), the particular combination of units that are in operation.

    <li>
        <p>
            3.2.2&emsp;
            In the electronic quarterly report required under §75.64, indicate for each hour of unit operation the operational bin associated with the NO<sub>x</sub> or flow rate data, by recording the number assigned to the bin under section 3.2.1 of this appendix.

            3.2.3&emsp;
            The data acquisition and handling system must be capable of properly identifying and recording the operational bin number for each unit operating hour. The DAHS must also be capable of calculating and recording the following information (as applicable) for each unit operating hour of missing flow or NO<sub>x</sub> data within each identified operational bin during the shorter of:
