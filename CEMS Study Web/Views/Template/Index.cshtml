<em>
    Daily Calibration Error Test -- Data Validation
</em>

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>
    What is EPA's policy on validation of emissions data based on the daily
    calibration error test?
</p>

<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>
    The following paragraphs summarize the provisions of Part 75 pertaining
    to data validation for daily calibration error tests (see Appendix B,
    Sections 2.1 through 2.1.5) and provide supplementary policy guidance for
    the implementation of those provisions.
</p>

    Part 75 Rule Provisions
</b>
<p>
    <text style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</text>: Daily calibration error tests of each continuous
    monitor used to report data under Part 75 are required. Additional
    calibration error tests are required whenever:
    <ol>
        <li>
            a calibration error test is
            failed;
        </li>
        <li>
            a monitor returns to service after corrective maintenance or
            repair; and
        </li>
        <li>
            following certain allowable calibration adjustments (see
            Section 2.1.3 of Appendix B).
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    A passed daily calibration test prospectively validates data from a
    continuous monitor for 26 clock hours (24 hours plus a two hour grace
    period), unless another calibration test is failed within that period or a
    maintenance event is conducted within that 26 hour period necessitating
    the completion of a calibration test to validate data following that event.
    Therefore, in order to report quality-assured data from a monitor, the data
    must be obtained within the 26 hour data validation window of a prior,
    passed daily calibration error test. Once a 26 hour data validation window
    has expired, data from the monitor are considered invalid until a
    subsequent calibration error test is passed. The only exception to this
    general rule is a grace period allowed for startup events (see discussion of
    grace period, below).
</p>
<p>
    When a daily calibration test is failed, the data from that monitor are
    prospectively invalidated, beginning with the hour of the test failure and
    ending when a subsequent daily calibration test is passed.
</p>
<p>
    <text style="text-decoration: underline">On-line vs. Off-line Calibration</text>: The basic requirement of Part 75 is that
    calibration error tests must be done on-line (i.e., with the unit operating),
    at typical operating conditions (see Section 2.1.1.1 of Appendix B).
    However, if a monitor is able to pass an off-line calibration error test
    demonstration in accordance with Section 2.1.1.2 of Appendix B, then the
    limited use of off-line calibration error tests for data validation is
    permitted for that monitor if:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            an on-line calibration error test has been
            passed within the previous 26 unit (or stack) operating hours; and
        </li>
        <li>
            the 26 clock hour data validation window for the off-line calibration error test
            has not expired.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    If either of these conditions is not met, then the data from
    the monitor are invalid with respect to the daily calibration error test
    requirement. Data from the monitor remain invalid until the appropriate
    on-line or off-line calibration error test is successfully completed so that
    both conditions (a) and (b) are met.
</p>
<p>
    This limited use of offline calibration error tests is particularly useful for
    peaking units that are frequently operated for only a few hours at a time.
</p>
<p>

    <text style="text-decoration: underline">Startup Grace Period</text>: An eight hour startup grace period may apply when
    a unit begins to operate after a period of non-operation. To qualify for a
    startup grace period, there are two requirements:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Following an outage of one or more hours, the unit must be in a startup
            condition and a startup event must have begun, as evidenced in the &le;HourlyOperatingData&gt;
            record by a change in unit operating time
            from zero in one clock hour to a positive unit operating time in the
            next clock hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the monitor used to validate data during the grace period, an <em>on-line</em>
            calibration error test of the monitor must have been completed and
            passed no more than 26 clock hours prior to the unit outage.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    If both of the above conditions are met, then a startup grace period of up to
    eight clock hours is allowed before an on-line calibration error test of the
    monitor used to validate data during the grace period is required. During
    the startup grace period, data generated by the CEMS are considered valid.
    A startup grace period ends when either:
    <ol type="A">
        <li>
            an on-line calibration error
            test of the monitor is completed; or
        </li>
        <li>
            eight <em>clock</em> hours have elapsed
            from the beginning of the startup event, whichever occurs first.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    If a unit shuts down during an eight hour grace period, when that unit
    resumes operations it does <em>not</em> qualify for a new eight hour grace period.
    Hours after resuming operations are considered invalid unless those hours
    are within the eight <em>clock</em> hour window following the initial startup after
    shutdown for which conditions (1) and (2) above are met.
</p>
<p>
    In certain instances, one or more clock hours within the eight hour
    window of a start-up grace period may coincide (overlap) with clock hours
    that are within a 26-hour window associated with a previous on-line
    calibration error test. In such instances, CEM data validation is governed
    by whichever window (i.e., the eight hour grace period or the 26-hour
    calibration window) expires <em>last</em>.
</p>
<b style="text-decoration: underline">
    Supplementary Policy Guidance
</b>
<p>
    Use the following additional guidelines to implement the calibration error
    provisions of Part 75:
    <ol>
        <li>
            A valid calibration error test consists of passing both a zero and an
            upscale calibration performed in sequence within the same clock hour
            or adjacent clock hours.
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    Do not report a partial calibration error test unless the partial test
                    fails to meet the calibration error specification, in which case, treat
                    it as a failed test and report it using the test result code of
                    "Aborted".
                </li>
                <li>
                    If either the zero or upscale portion of a <em>completed</em> calibration error
                    test fails, the monitor is considered to be out-of-control starting
                    with the hour of the earliest failed injection (or calibration signal).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            If more than one calibration is reported in a given clock hour, report
            the calibrations in time order (the order in which the calibrations were
            conducted).
        </li>
        <li>
            A <em>passed</em> calibration error test may be used to <em>prospectively</em> validate
            data for the hour in which it is performed <em>only</em> if the minimum data
            requirements of § 75.10(d)(1) are met for the clock hour (i.e., at least
            two valid data points are obtained during the hour, at least 15-minutes
            apart). In the case where a calibration error test is failed, followed by
            corrective actions and a subsequent successful calibration, all within
            the same clock hour---the hour may be reported as valid provided that
            sufficient data are collected <em>after</em> the subsequent successful calibration
            to validate the hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Except as specified in paragraph (5), below, a passed calibration error
            test may not be used to validate data if the monitor is out-of-control
            with respect to any of its other required QA tests (e.g., linearity
            checks, RATAs).
        </li>
        <li>
            When a significant change is made to a monitoring system or when a
            monitor is repaired and additional recertification or diagnostic tests are
            required to demonstrate that a monitor previously declared to be outof-
            control is back in-control, a passed calibration error test may, in
            accordance with the provisions of § 75.20(b)(3), be used as a
            "probationary calibration error test" to initiate a period of
            "conditionally valid data" (see definitions in § 72.2) until the required
            recertification or diagnostic tests are completed. If the required tests
            are then passed in succession within the window of time allotted under
            § 75.20(b)(3)(iv), with no failures, the out-of-control period ends at the
            date and hour of the probationary calibration error test. [See also
            similar provisions in § 75.20(d) and Section 2.2.5.3 of Appendix B.]

    Detailed Examples
</b>
<p>
    The following examples illustrate data validation for <em>on-line</em> calibration error tests and
    the use of a start-up grace period. The examples assume that for the hour in which a
    calibration error test is passed, sufficient valid data are collected <em>after</em> the calibration
    error test to validate data for that hour. In other words, the hour in which the calibration
    error test is passed is considered to be the first hour in the 26 clock hour window of data
    validation associated with the calibration error test.

<br />
<br />
<p>
    In examples 1 through 5 below, assume that the unit has been operating for some time,
    and that on Day 1 a daily calibration was passed at 7:00 a.m. (validating data from Day 1,
    Hour 7 through Day 2, Hour 8, and that no calibration error test is failed in that interval).
    Examples 1 through 5 are not connected in any way---each represents a different
    scenario.

<br />
<br />
<p>
    Assume for Examples 6 through 10, below that the unit has been off-line for several days,
    that the last on-line calibration error test was passed 18 hours before the hour of unit
    shutdown, and that the unit begins operation on Day 1 at 1:01 am, during Hour 1. The
    unit therefore qualifies for a start-up grace period. Four possible scenarios are shown in
    Examples 6 through 10:
