        <em>General Record Keeping Provisions</em>. The owner or operator of any affected unit shall maintain for each affected unit and each non-affected unit under §75.72(b)(2)(ii) a file of all measurements, data, reports, and other information required by this part at the source in a form suitable for inspection for at least three (3) years from the date of each record. Except for the certification data required in §75.57(a)(4) and the initial submission of the monitoring plan required in §75.57(a)(5), the data shall be collected beginning with the earlier of the date of provisional certification or the compliance deadline in §75.70(b). The certification data required in §75.57(a)(4) shall be collected beginning with the date of the first certification test performed. The file shall contain the following information:
